# SimpleFlightsManagementSystem

This project was created for my Object-Oriented Programming I class (COMP248 - Winter 2025) and later modified after completing Object-Oriented Programming II (COMP249 - Summer 2025).

It is built using Java and demonstrates concepts such as
- oop concepts (classes, methods, encapsulation)
- error handling

## Features
- modify flight details (name, code, permit, pilot)
- add/delete flight attendants and passengers
- display flight details and passengers list

## How to Run
1. download or clone the repository
2. open it in an IDE (Eclipse or IntelliJ)
3. compile and run Main.java
